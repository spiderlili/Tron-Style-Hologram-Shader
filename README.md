# Tron-Style-Hologram-Shader 
A hologram style unlit shader to control the colour and transparency of the object, manipulate its vertices during rendering to produce periodic flickering glitches. This is achieved by using a sine wave effect in the vertex shader.Â Clipping is used to make parts of the image disappear during the glitches.
